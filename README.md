# Emotion Detection using Hugging Face Transformers  

This project focuses on **emotion detection** using a dataset processed with **Hugging Face's Transformer** models. The goal was to classify emotions from textual data, but initial results yielded an accuracy of **32%**.  

## Dataset Details  
The dataset consists of labeled text data representing different emotions. The distribution of labels is as follows:  

| Label | Count |
|-------|-------|
| 1     | 5362  |
| 0     | 4666  |
| 3     | 2159  |
| 4     | 1937  |
| 2     | 1304  |
| 5     | 572   |
| **Total** | **15,900** |

## Approach  
- Used **Hugging Face's Transformer** models for emotion classification.  
- Fine-tuned a **pre-trained model** on the dataset.  
- Achieved an accuracy of **32%**, indicating room for improvement.  

## ðŸ”¥ Future Improvements  
To enhance the model's performance, I plan to:  
- **Experiment with different transformer architectures** to find a better fit.  
- **Apply data augmentation techniques** to improve generalization.  
- **Optimize hyperparameters** using advanced tuning methods.  
- **Increase dataset size** or balance class distribution for better learning.  

ðŸš€ **I'm interested in improving this model further! Contributions and suggestions are welcome!**
